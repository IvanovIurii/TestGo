1. install packages: Mux router, Mongo, Toml
- go get -u -v github.com/gorilla/mux
- go get -u -v gopkg.in/mgo.v2
- go get -u -v github.com/BurntSushi/toml

2. install mongoDB

3. put DB configuration to config.toml, if you have other DB port, e.g.
server="127.0.0.1:27017"
database="posts"

4. run mongoDB: 
- for Windows, so "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin\mongod.exe"

5. run main.go
- go run main.go -> the server will be run in http://localhost:8080 

6. CURL for testing
- GET /login - to get TOKEN, which then you have to use to authenticate in HEADER

- POST /posts - to create a post, for example:
curl -H "Token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdXRob3JpemVkIjp0cnVlLCJleHAiOjE1NDMzNjEyNDcsInVzZXIiOiJpdXJpaSJ9.dxZ3FISCEfIPpoYuE9tBvFrTKAJ7beElCIWGxB_lvKU" -d '{"title":"test", "content":"test"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/posts

where "Token" was generated by "/login",

{"title":"test", "content":"test", "created":"timestamp"} is payload

- GET /posts - get all posts
curl -H "Token":"<TOKEN>" http://localhost:8080/posts 

where "Token" was generated by "/login"

- GET /posts/{id} - get exact post by id
 curl -H "Token":"<TOKEN>" http://localhost:8080/posts/3

- PUT /posts - update post
curl -H "Token":"<TOKEN>" 
-d '{"id":"<_id>", "title":"test NEW", "content":"test"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT http://localhost:8080/posts

- DELETE /posts/{id} - delete posts
curl -H "Token":"<TOKEN>" -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/posts/{id}

From scrach DB is empty, it is  droped every run of main.go (see init() in rest.go)

NOTE: to test in your ENV it should be extracted here $GOPATH/src/github.com/
The whole path will be like that: $GOPATH/src/github.com/<name_of_the_working_directory>
